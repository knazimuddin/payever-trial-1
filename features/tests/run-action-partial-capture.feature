  Background:
    Given I remember as "businessId" following value:
    """
    "36bf8981-8827-4c0c-a645-02d9fc6d72c8"

    """
    "ad738281-f9f0-4db7-a4f6-670b0dff5327"

  Scenario: Do shipping goods action with missing identifier in item
    Given I authenticate as a user with the following data:
    """
    {"email": "email@email.com","roles": [{"name": "merchant","permissions": [{"businessId": "{{businessId}}","acls": []}]}]}
    """

        }
      }
    }

    And I use DB fixture "transactions/partial-capture/third-party-payment"

    Then print last response
    And the response status code should be 200
    And the response should contain json:
